## Introduction 

Cricket in Pakistan has evolved to be a lifeline of passion, unity, and hope for millions. Growing up in Pakistan, I witnessed firsthand how the game transcended boundaries, becoming a source of pride and solace amidst societal challenges. Cricket brought us together in joy and despair, embedding itself as a cornerstone of our identity. However, recent performances of the Pakistan cricket team have tested the patience and spirit of its ardent supporters. Under Babar Azam's leadership, the team has faced a series of crushing defeats. The Asia Cup 2023 was a heartbreak, with Pakistan bowing out in disarray against arch-rivals India and Sri Lanka, failing to reach the final. The ICC ODI Cricket World Cup that followed brought even more pain. The squad, once considered among the favorites, stumbled through the tournament, marred by inconsistent performances, questionable tactics, and criticism of Babar Azam's captaincy.


These setbacks have cast a shadow over Pakistan's cricketing future. Fans and analysts alike have questioned whether Babar Azam, despite his stellar batting record, possesses the leadership qualities to guide the team in high-pressure situations. The narrative of a captain unable to inspire his players or make bold decisions has dominated headlines As someone who grew up idolizing cricket legends and dreaming of a thriving Pakistan cricket team, these losses feel a lot too personal. They raise difficult questions including that are we pinning our hopes on the wrong leader? Is it fair to hold Babar Azam solely accountable for the team's shortcomings? These questions drive my exploration of his leadership through this project to understand if the captaincy is a burden or an opportunity for him to cement his legacy.


# Methods

To explore the leadership and performance of Babar Azam as captain, I combined statistical modeling, data visualization, and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal was to critically assess whether Babar Azam's captaincy has positively influenced the Pakistan cricket team and whether his individual performance has been affected by the pressures of leadership. The analysis was designed with the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 in mind, as One day International (ODI) cricket will be the tournament's format, making it the most relevant for immediate evaluation.


Cricket is played in three formats, Test, ODI, and T20, but I deliberately chose to focus on ODIs for several reasons. First, the ICC Champions Trophy, second most prestigious global tournaments next to the World Cup, is an ODI competition. Evaluating Babar's performance and the team's dynamics in this format is directly relevant to assessing readiness for this high-stakes event. Second, ODIs strike a balance between the patience and endurance of Test cricket and the high-octane pace of T20s, demanding adaptability and decision-making. Lastly, ODI matches typically generate the most accessible and consistent datasets for longitudinal analysis, given their structured nature and longer history in international cricket.

I began with data collection using the cricketdata package, which allowed me to fetch Babar Azam's match-by-match statistics. I curated the data to focus on ODIs, to ensure that key variables like match result, opposition, toss outcome, and batting performance were included. The dataset was further refined by creating variables to distinguish matches played under his captaincy and those as a regular player, along with home versus away contexts. The statistical analysis included regression modeling to investigate whether Babar's captaincy status or match conditions (e.g., home vs. away) significantly affected his batting performance. The motivation behind doing so was whether the additional responsibility of captaincy had any measurable impact on his contributions as a batsman.For visualization, static plots were generated to depict career trends, such as his average runs before and after assuming captaincy. 


Interactive Shiny apps further enriched the analysis by showing Babar Azam's impact on the Pakistan cricket team. The apps allow users to look into key aspects such as team performance under his leadership, the influence of toss outcomes on match results, and Babar’s personal milestones, such as centuries scored. To support these apps, I extracted match data from ESPNcricinfo's Statsguru platform. The data was saved in the form of the odi_result.csv files. Statsguru's detailed match-by-match breakdown provides essential information, including match outcomes, opposition, toss results, and Babar Azam’s individual contributions. The extraction process involved querying the platform for all ODIs featuring Pakistan from the beginning of Babar Azam's career to the present.. Variables such as "Result," "Toss," and "Batting Order" were retained as they were essential for answering key questions about leadership and performance dynamics. The inclusion of the "Start Date" variable allowed me to clearly distinguish matches played during Babar Azam's captaincy (from October 30, 2020, onward) from those played before he assumed this role.


# NLP Techniques and Challenges


To complement the statistical evaluation, I employed NLP techniques to analyze sentiment around Babar Azam's captaincy in news articles and public discourse. Text data was scraped from the International Cricket Council (ICC) website, processed to remove noise (e.g., stopwords and punctuation), and analyzed using sentiment lexicons like AFINN, Bing, and NRC.
The NLP component presented me with some challenges. First, cleaning and preprocessing cricket-related text was particularly difficult due to the frequent use of cricketing jargon, abbreviations, and context-specific phrases that standard lexicons often misinterpret. For example, words like "wicket" or "collapse" can have drastically different connotations depending on the article's context. Second, aligning the sentiment scores with performance metrics required careful synchronization of textual and numerical data.

# Findings

# Performance Trends

Babar Azam's role as a captain and batsman in ODI cricket was examined across key metrics to understand whether his captaincy has had an impact on his batting performance and team outcomes. The regression model offers a statistical lens into Babar Azam’s batting performance, focusing on whether captaincy or match location (home vs. away) influenced his runs. The intercept, representing the runs scored when Babar was captain and playing away, establishes a baseline for comparison. The coefficient for captaincy status ("Not Captain") suggests no significant decline or improvement in performance when he wasn’t leading. Similarly, the home-away factor, while marginally significant, hints that playing at home might provide a slight boost to his performance. Interestingly, the interaction term between captaincy and home/away status showed no notable impact on runs. This finding dispels the notion that additional responsibilities under certain conditions (e.g., home advantage) drastically affect his batting contributions. The low R-squared value, however, indicates that other unmeasured factors likely play a role in influencing his performance, such as pitch conditions, opposition quality, or match pressure.

What stands out from the Average Runs Against Opponents plot is his improved performance against formidable teams such as South Africa and New Zealand after taking on the captaincy. For instance, his average against South Africa increased to 69.5 runs, demonstrating his ability to lead from the front against strong opponents. Conversely, his averages against India and England remain areas of concern, with only slight improvement, indicating a potential struggle against high-pressure rivals. His struggles against England (53.8 to 39.9 runs) and India (30 to 31.6 runs) point to areas where external pressures may have played a part.


# Toss Impact Analysis

The second Shiny App focuses on the impact of toss outcomes under Babar's captaincy revealed that  matches where Pakistan won the toss had a higher win percentage compared to when they lost the toss. Specifically, during Babar’s captaincy, 17 out of 26 matches were won when Pakistan won the toss, translating to a win percentage of approximately 65%. What this speaks to is the significance of the toss in setting favorable conditions for the team, particularly in key matches.

# Sentiment Analysis

The sentiment analysis using AFINN, Bing, and NRC lexicons shows a balanced perspective in cricket articles about Babar Azam. While most articles lean positive, reflecting his popularity and achievements, a noticeable proportion exhibit negative sentiments, particularly following losses in the Asia Cup and ICC World Cup. Terms like "trust," "captain," and "victory" are frequently associated with positive sentiment, which all speak to the narrative of Babar as a capable leader. However, words like "loss," "injury," and "dismissal" reflect the recurring challenges faced during his tenure. On the other hand, the Average Sentiment Plot paints a mixed picture, while Babar enjoys widespread support, critical defeats have fueled negative narratives. The patterns draw attention to how external circumstances, including team performance and opposition strength, influence public evaluation of his leadership.

The minimum sentiment score of -2 and the maximum of 4 (based on the AFINN lexicon) is an indication that while most content is generally positive, there are still notable negative mentions. The avg_afinn value of 1.17 shows an overall positive but not particularly strong sentiment across the articles. The summary output contains Bing and NRC sentiments, with totals for positive and negative word counts. There were 450 Bing-positive mentions and 275 Bing-negative mentions, showing a positive trend overall.	NRC sentiment shows a similar distribution with 332 positive words and 275 negative words, confirming the general positive tone towards Babar Azam




# Future Research
Future research could expand this analysis by incorporating comparisons with other contemporary players, both within Pakistan and internationally, to contextualize Babar Azam’s performance and leadership. Looking at  captains like Virat Kohli, Steve Smith, or Kane Williamson during similar stages of their careers could provide interesting takeaways into the challenges and expectations faced by captains who are also key batters. Moreover, extending the scope beyond ODIs to include T20Is and Test matches would offer a holistic view of Babar’s influence across formats, and will ten how his leadership and performance adapt to varying pressures and dynamics. Incorporating advanced data, such as ball-by-ball analysis, strike rate progression, or performance under specific match scenarios (e.g., chasing vs. setting a target), could provide an overarching understanding of his contributions. Sentiment analysis could also be broadened by including social media data to capture real-time public opinion, especially during critical matches or tournaments. Finally, exploring team strategies, such as the impact of toss results on other players’ performances or fielding strategies, would offer an even detailed view of how leadership influences the overall team ecosystem.
